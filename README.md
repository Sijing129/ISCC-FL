# ISCC-FL
This is the code for Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation for Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning. Following are the brief introductions of each file.
* main_fed.py is the main file.
* data_set.py is the pre-processor of the dataset.
* Folder data and model include the human motion recognition datasets, and the AI models, respectively.

Notice that for the optimization algorithm about the network resources, this version just provides an example value.
